## Topics to go over
- [ ] Find out why the utility function for the Scanner wasn't returning any data. Is it something with pointers?
- [ ] Module system in golang
    - Wanted to split the `part1` function out so that it is testable but it seem like the "main" module of a golang project is treated differently? Something like that
